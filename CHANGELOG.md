## [Unreleased] - ReleaseDate

## [0.1.2] - 2020-02-14

This release completes the documentation
(at least every public item is documented).

### Changed
- Replaced `Pattern::{from_expr, to_expr}` with `From` and `TryFrom`
  implementations.

## [0.1.1] - 2020-02-13

### Added
- A lot of documentation

### Changed
- The graphviz visualization now looks a lot better; enode argument
  come out from the "correct" position based on which argument they
  are.

## [0.1.0] - 2020-02-11

This is egg's first real release!

Hard to make a changelog on the first release, since basically
everything has changed!
But hopefully things will be a little more stable from here on out
since the API is a lot nicer.
